# Curve Fitting for Life Expectancy Data

In this project, which was a final project for a course called MAT 167: Applied Linear Algebra, we used MATLAB to implement various algorithms which fit a curve to best describe the relationship between a country's average life expectancy and the average years of schooling for citizen's of that country. We compared the fit of linear, quadratic, cubic, and logarithmic curves using the 2-norm of the residuals vector. Curves were fit to the data by solving the least squares problem using the psuedoinverse, 3 different algorithms for QR decomposition (Classical Gram-Shmidt, Modified Gram-Schmidt, Householder Triangularization) and Singular Value Decomposition.
